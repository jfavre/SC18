\title{Response to the comments of Referee \# 1}


\begin{document}
\maketitle
\textbf{Referee:} This paper reviews a comparison of 3 volume rendering techniques available in ParaView. The comparison is important and the observations will have real-world effects, thank you for writing this paper. The paper is generally well written and understandable. \\
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Response:} We thank the referee for his/her nice words about our work. } \\

My only overall gripe is that I have a hard time deciding how important the GPU units are. The only table in which GPU is directly compared with the CPU is in Table 1. you claim in the conclusion that you didn't do distributed memory parallel for OSPRay because it didn't support threads per process in your MPI environment... Why? (I thought that worked...) Certainly you could have done a single MPI process for each core, which isn't optimal, but would have at least allowed some kind of comparison of the GPU vs. CPU.  (This is important for in situ and spec'ing dedicated visualization machines: get more large nodes or get more nodes with GPUs?). Can I use OSPRay to get interactive rendering on the full data with sufficient resources and full pixel coverage? At a minimum I would like to see a bit more explanation as to why not distributed memory parallel without GPU.\\
\textcolor{red}{To be done}

\textbf{Referee:} Some other nits(some necessary, some just suggestions):
For this paper, in this context, you should note this is a paper that accompanied a visualization showcase entry in the introduction or remove references to the showcase like "For this visualization showcase ..." \\
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Response:} To further clarify this, we moved the following sentence from section 2 to the introduction. 'In the accompanying video [citation to Favre et al.] we are able to display the previously two-dimensionally presented flow structures in a three-dimensional motion. The reader is led through a presentation of one specific flow case with sheared thermal convection and can experience the dynamics of the thermal structures while being informed about different flow parameters.' } \\


\textbf{Referee:} "Our hopes is that ..."  $\rightarrow$ our hope is \\
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Response:} This typo was corrected.} \\

“Amongst” $\rightarrow$ among\\

“Transferred over from CPU …” $\rightarrow$ transferred from cpu to\\ 

“The edition of color” $\rightarrow$ The addition of color\\

“Analyse” $\rightarrow$ analyze\\

“(XAC)” is blowing the column margin … (you could start that sentence with a “The”?)\\

In the abstract: “we evaluate different implementations” $\rightarrow$ We evaluate different volume rendering implementations ….\\
